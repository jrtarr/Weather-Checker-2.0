            <p>Having some trouble with the app? Have no fear!</p>
            <p>It's easy to use - from the home page, just type in the name or address of the location you'd like to check the weather for.</p>
            <p>From there, we'll use some computer magic (plus the help of DarkSky's weather API and MapBox's geocoding API) to find the weather for your location!</p>

            <h2>FAQ's</h2>
            <p><b>Nothing's happening when I click "Search". What gives?</b><br/>Be patient, pal! We use the help of some over services behind the scenes to get all that fancy weather data, and sometimes it takes a while to load. If things never load, it's possible there's issues on those services ends.</p>
            <p><b>When I searched for my address, I got an error!</b><br/>That's not a question, but don't worry! Most locations and addresses will work, but occassionally we're unable to find the location you're looking for. Double check for typos, and if there are none, try another nearby address or landmark!</p>
            <p><b>How does the website already know where I am when I connect for the first time?</b><br/>We take a guess at your location based on the IP address you're connected to the internet through. This isn't 100% accurate all the time though, so it's possible we could be off by a little bit.</p>
